Here's a rewritten version of the message that's more conversational, incorporates relevant points from the policy, and aims to be more motivating:\n\nHey there! Thanks for jumping in on this review. I've got some good news and some room for improvement for you.\n\nSo, here's the scoop: You've earned 15 points for this review. Not bad, but let me break it down for you:\n\nYou started with a solid 25-point base - that's automatic for every review. Nice! \n\nNow, I noticed you only left one comment. The policy encourages more engagement, aiming for at least 6 comments to avoid a 10-point deduction. Unfortunately, we had to apply that deduction here.\n\nBut hey, look on the bright side! You didn't review your own code (that would've cost you 40 points), and you showed up to participate. That's great!\n\nWant to boost your points next time? Here are some tips:\n1. Leave more comments - you can earn up to 20 points for that!\n2. If you're reviewing a larger piece of code (15+ hits-of-code), you'll avoid another 10-point deduction.\n3. The more substantial the code review, the more points you can rack up (up to 40 points for the code size alone).\n\nYour current balance is -579, but don't let that discourage you. Every review is a chance to climb up. Remember, you can earn up to 100 points per review!\n\nKeep at it, and let's see those points soar.
